-  Which type of transactional database system would work best for product data?
	- OLTP systems support a large set of users, have quick response times, handle large volumes of data, are highly available, and are great for small or relatively simple transactions. An OLTP system would work best for transactional data like product data that's closely linked to inventory
- Suppose a retailer's operations to update inventory and process payments are in the same transaction. A user is trying to apply a $30 store credit on an order from their laptop and is submitting the exact same order by using the store credit (for the full amount) from their phone. Two identical orders are received. The database behind the scenes is an ACID-compliant database. What will happen?
	- One order will be processed and use in-store credit, and the other order wont be processed. When the second order determines that the in-store credit has already been used, it will roll back the transaction
