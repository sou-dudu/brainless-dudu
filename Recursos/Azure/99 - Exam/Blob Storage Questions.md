Which of the following describes a good strategy for creating storage accounts and blob containers for your application?
Creating an Azure Storage account is an administrative activity and can be done prior to deploying an application. Container creation is lightweight and is often driven by run-time data which makes it a good activity to do in your application.

Which of the following can be used to initialize the Blob Storage client library within an application?

A storage account connection string contains all the information needed to connect to Blob storage, most importantly the account name and the account key.

What happens when you obtain a `BlobClient` reference from `BlobContainerClient` with the name of a blob?

Getting a blob reference does not make any calls to Azure Storage, it simply creates an object locally that can work with a stored blob.
